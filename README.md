Have you ever wanted a tool like in KR where they get the most optimal accessory + engraving book + ability stone setup in a few seconds?

Well, today is the day. Unfortunately, we still do not have access to a market API in NA and EU, but we can still utilize an optimization tool by manually entering the accessory and engraving book data.

The tool will then calculate the best combinations and lets you choose among the top 5.

Play with the settings to save literally millions of gold in the long run.

So far, I have only worked on it for an hour, but it already works just fine and I built my own character with it.

I want to open source the tool so we can build upon this together.

Maybe we can add OCR so it scans the market automatically for even faster input (not sure about ToS here).

Please let me know what you think of this tool! https://github.com/Darkestry/LostArkAccessoryOptimizer

Note: Some development effort is required, you gotta know a little bit of Python.
